# Praqmatic Lego game
At [http://praqma.com/](Praqma) we have run quite a bit of training in Agile Task Management. Recently while doing [http://www.code-conf.com/academy2016/](CoDe Academy) we added the [http://lego4scrum.com/](LEGO scrum game). 

The reason that we have added the LEGO scrum game to our toolbox is
that it allows us to run a number of very short sprints with focus
being on the managing the backlog. Introducing some malicious Product
Owners also allows us to simulate the frustrations of dealing with
real world issues such as changing requirements and priorities,
product owners that might not know what they want, know anything about
the domain or care about details.

The actual sprints lasts seven minutes, this is rarely where the
actual learning is taking place, so it is nice that with the LEGOs we
can actually move closer to a finished product in such a short amount
of time. Using LEGOs to induce frustration also removes a bit of the
tension.

This document describes the implementation as used by Praqma of the LEGO scrum game platform from lego4scrum.

## Pre-game prep 
### Supplies 
* Lots of post-its - a pad per team
* Pens
* Something to provide a surface on which to place the cities - large pieces of paper will do
* Boards, flipovers or big pieces of paper that you can put on a wall. These will hold the swim lanes
* LEGO bricks - set #6177 is recommeded by lego4scrum. Anything that does not force the users into specific things will work. One box per team.
